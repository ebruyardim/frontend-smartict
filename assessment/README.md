After that organizing, I have iterate in positions array and I have created an object of each position name and organization name.

I have inserted the objects into 'positionsWithOrgNames' array.

### question 2

For this question, I have created an object which keeps last item. Item is data that keeps last function called, and its input and result variables.

So, I can control easily next function call. If the function and its input is the same with my object keeping as global variable, Then result will be shown without calculating again.
